  <p class="p-5"> If you're looking for random paragraphs, you've come to the right place.
     When a random word or a random sentence isn't quite enough, the next logical
     step is to find a random paragraph. We created the Random Paragraph
     Generator with you in mind. The process is quite simple. Choose the number
     of random paragraphs you'd like to see and click the button. Your chosen
     number of paragraphs will instantly appear.
hile it may not be obvious to everyone, there are a number of reasons creating
random paragraphs can be useful. A few examples of how some people use this
generator are listed in the following paragraphs. It's not only writers who can
benefit from this free online tool. If you're a programmer who's working on a
project where blocks of text are needed, this tool can be a great way to get that
. It's a good way to test your programming and that the tool being created is
 working well.Above are a few examples of how the random paragraph generator can
  be beneficial. The best way to see if this random paragraph picker will be
  useful for your intended purposes is to give it a try. Generate a number of
   paragraphs to see if they are beneficial to your current project.  If you do
   find this paragraph tool useful, please do us a favor and let us know how you
   're using it. It's greatly beneficial for us to know the different ways this
    tool is being used so we can improve it with updates. This is especially true
     since there are times when the generators we create get used in completely
     unanticipated ways from when we initially created them. If you have the time
     , please send us a quick note on what you'd like to see changed or added
      to make it better in the future. Debbie put her hand into the hole,
      sliding her hand down as far as her arm could reach. She wiggled her
      fingers hoping to touch something, but all she felt was air. She shifted
      the weight of her body to try and reach an inch or two more down the hole.
      Her fingers still touched nothing but air. He watched as the young man
      tried to impress everyone in the room with his intelligence. There was no
      doubt that he was smart. The fact that he was more intelligent than anyone
       else in the room could have been easily deduced, but nobody was really
       paying any attention due to the fact that it was also obvious that the
       young man only cared about his intelligence.
He couldn't move. His head throbbed and spun. He couldn't decide if it was the
 flu or the drinking last night. It was probably a combination of both.
He had three simple rules by which he lived. The first was to never eat blue food
. There was nothing in nature that was edible that was blue. People often asked
about blueberries, but everyone knows those are actually purple. He understood
it was one of the stranger rules to live by, but it had served him well thus far
 in the 50+ years of his life.There was something in the tree. It was difficult
  to tell from the ground, but Rachael could see movement. She squinted her eyes
  and peered in the direction of the movement, trying to decipher exactly what
  she had spied. The more she peered, however, the more she thought it might be
  a figment of her imagination. Nothing seemed to move until the moment she began
   to take her eyes off the tree. Then in the corner of her eye, she would see
   the movement again and begin the process of staring again.It's always good to
    bring a slower friend with you on a hike. If you happen to come across bears
    , the whole group doesn't have to worry. Only the slowest in the group do.
    That was the lesson they were about to learn that day.

         resistance to taxation, is punishable by law. Taxes consist of direct
         or indirect taxes and may be paid in money or as its labour equivalent.
          The first known taxation took place in Ancient Egypt around 3000–2800 BC.
          Most countries have a tax system in place to pay for public, common or
           agreed national needs and government functions. Some levy a flat
           percentage rate of taxation on personal annual income, but most scale
            taxes based on annual income amounts. Most countries charge a tax on
             an individual's income as well as on corporate income. Countries or
              subunits often also impose wealth taxes, inheritance taxes, estate
               taxes, gift taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, payroll taxes or
